# ParallelizedShiftExactPermTest
Parallelized version of the Shift-method for exact permutations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

python3.6 has been used to test out the repository. The installation uses anaconda, but it is not necessary.

A GPU that uses CUDA is necessary.

Only Python-specific requirements are Numba, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

## Run time performance increase.

The GPU allows for substantial speed up for larger matrices.

## How the parallization works.

It's highly recommended to read https://github.com/hoehleatsu/permtest/blob/master/computation.pdf to be able to follow the explanation of the parallelization implementation.

To obtain the sought of permutations N(m,m+n), a matrix can be created and then recursevely fill the entries for each N(j,k) using the relation(order of don't matter):

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=N(j,k)=&space;N(j-1,k-1)$\bigoplus$&space;z_{k}&space;&plus;&space;N(j,k-1)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N(j,k)=&space;N(j-1,k-1)$\bigoplus$&space;z_{k}&space;&plus;&space;N(j,k-1)" title="N(j,k)= N(j-1,k-1)$\bigoplus$ z_{k} + N(j,k-1)" /></a>

The matrix looks as follows

Only the 2D array of j and k is sufficient to see the parallelization-pattern, see figure below.

From the figure above, one realizes that for a fixed k, each j-element in that kth row is independent of each other. Hence, it's possible to calculate each j element in that row parallelly. Furthermore, each k row is consecutively calculated in this manner.

The matrix is calculated in a loop over k to finally obtain the sought of N(m,m+n).
